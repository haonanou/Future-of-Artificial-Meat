## Task Analysis & Question

__Research Question__

*__Depending on if they have heard about artificial meat and where they have heard from, how likely is the demographic willing to try it for the first time or again if given a choice?__*

Since, the final question is dependent upon on two or more questions, it seem a heirarchial model will be a better fit to visualize it. Using the circle packing visualization we can see how distributed the surveys where from Q9 (Have you heard about artificial meat?), Q10 (where or from whom they heard first about artificial meat), Q12 (Have you tried it?), Q16 (if given choice, will you try it or try it again?).
`D3 js` is used to draw the circle packing visualization since it was comparatively time consuming and difficult with other libraries.
A parallel Co-ordinate diagram was also drawn to see how surveys varied from each of the questions and relation between consecutive 2 questions.
